# Class work from UC Berkeley's CS 61B Data Structures and Algorithms class

In 2020, I set a goal to become a better programmer.  To improve my skill level, I worked through UC Berkeley's sophomore data structures and algorithms course [CS61B](https://sp19.datastructur.es).  I completed all of the projects, homeworks, discussions, labs, readings, and exams.  This is my work product.
